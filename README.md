# Leetcode_I_am_fish_bundle

**A bundle of Leetcode solutions.**

**Programming languages:** Python 3, C++, Rust, Go 

**File extensions:** .py, .cpp, .rs, .go 

**Why not JavaScript or C#?**
I find JavaScript and C# to be quite similar to Python and C++ for coding challenges. For example, in C++, you would use int *matrixLength = matrix.size();*, whereas in C#, it would be *int matrixLength = matrix.Length;*, in Java, *int matrixLength = matrix.length;*, and in JavaScript, *const matrixLength = matrix.length;*. The main difference is that C++ uses the vector object, which has a function to return the size, while the others use a size attribute.

That said, JavaScript and C# have their unique strengths outside of coding challenges. JavaScript excels in web development and asynchronous programming, while C# is widely used for enterprise applications and is deeply integrated into the .NET ecosystem. These differences may be more significant in other contexts, but for the purposes of algorithm-based coding challenges, the similarities between these languages make them somewhat interchangeable.

**Naming convention:**
The filename consists of the language name followed by a number that indicates the version of the solution. For example, p3two means it's my second solution using Python 3.

**Note:** Some solution names may be unconventional or not safe for work.
